# TransformersBabySteps
With this repository I would like to get to know the world of transformers a little bit better. Since the release of LLM as GPT-3 or the newest chatGPT, I feel a little bit threatned by how good these Models can produce code and not only. I think It might be worth the time to jump on the wagon of the future and understand how these things works.
